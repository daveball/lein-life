Rents is a Leiningen template to give your project a better environment and chance in life than Mark Renton! It utilises Docker to give you a production like environment running locally on your dev machine where things like metrics and logging now become first class citizens of you dev lifecycle.


# Usage
[![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/garycrawford/lein-life/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/garycrawford/lein-life/branch/master)

_Caveat - heavy development underway... functionality being added rapidly and changes made regularly._

## Dependencies
To use Life generated projects to their full potential in a dev environment you will need to install Docker and Docker Compose.

## Creating projects
You can use this template by executing:

    $ lein new life <project-name> <type> [options]

    Types:
      api      | Create a new web api
      site     | Create a new site
      site+api | Create a new site with a new api backend
    
    Options:
      -d, --db   | DATABASE  | Database to be used. Currently only supports `mongodb`
      -s, --site | SITE-NAME | Name of the site project
      -a, --api  | API-NAME  | Name of the api project
      -h, --help |           |


You can then launch the igenerated app or site by executing:

    $ cd <project-name>
    $ docker-compose up

I find that the Text Triumvirate (zsh, vim & tmux) gives me everything I need for effective Clojure development with Life (see my setup below) however templates should be compatible with the IDE & shell combo of your choice.

## Working with a Life generated project
### Get REPL to api or site
When you connect to a REPL in a Life project the REPL is actually running inside a Docker containe, so you have to do a remote connection to it:

    ;; site
    $ lein repl :connect 192.168.59.103:21212
    
    ;; api
    $ lein repl :connect 192.168.59.103:31313
    
### Enable autotest

    ;; enabling autotest in repl will rerun tests when chnages are saved
    user=> (autotest)
    
### Start site or API

    ;; start the API or site
    user=> (go)
    
    ;; refresh changes you have made
    user=> (reset)
    
    ;; stop the API or site
    user=> (stop)
    
### Viewing metrics
The screenshot below shows the default metrics available as soon as you start your Life project.

To see these simply browse to http://192.168.59.103. (N.B. so far this is only tested on a Mac using boot2docker). You will start to see stats once you start your 'site' or 'API' (see above).

N.B. boot2docker has a clock skew issue - if you cannot see metrics you should try running the following command on the host:

    $ boot2docker ssh sudo ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org
