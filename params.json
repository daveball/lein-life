It utilises Docker to give you a production like environment running locally on your dev machine where things like metrics and logging now become first class citizens of you dev lifecycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n[![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/garycrawford/lein-life/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/garycrawford/lein-life/branch/master)\r\n\r\n_Caveat - heavy development underway... functionality being added rapidly and changes made regularly._\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nTo use Life generated projects to their full potential in a dev environment you will need to install Docker and Docker Compose.\r\n\r\n## Creating projects\r\nYou can use this template by executing:\r\n\r\n    $ lein new life <project-name> <type> [options]\r\n\r\n    Types:\r\n      api      | Create a new web api\r\n      site     | Create a new site\r\n      site+api | Create a new site with a new api backend\r\n    \r\n    Options:\r\n      -d, --db   | DATABASE  | Database to be used. Currently only supports `mongodb`\r\n      -s, --site | SITE-NAME | Name of the site project\r\n      -a, --api  | API-NAME  | Name of the api project\r\n      -h, --help |           |\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can then launch the igenerated app or site by executing:\r\n\r\n    $ cd <project-name>\r\n    $ docker-compose up\r\n\r\nI find that the Text Triumvirate (zsh, vim & tmux) gives me everything I need for effective Clojure development with Life (see my setup below) however templates should be compatible with the IDE & shell combo of your choice.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garycrawford/lein-life/master/images/IDE.png\" alt=\"Tmux and Vim\" title=\"Tmux and Vim for Clojure development\" />\r\n\r\n## Working with a Life generated project\r\n### Get REPL to api or site\r\nWhen you connect to a REPL in a Life project the REPL is actually running inside a Docker containe, so you have to do a remote connection to it:\r\n\r\n    ;; site\r\n    $ lein repl :connect 192.168.59.103:21212\r\n    \r\n    ;; api\r\n    $ lein repl :connect 192.168.59.103:31313\r\n    \r\n### Enable autotest\r\n\r\n    ;; enabling autotest in repl will rerun tests when chnages are saved\r\n    user=> (autotest)\r\n    \r\n### Start site or API\r\n\r\n    ;; start the API or site\r\n    user=> (go)\r\n    \r\n    ;; refresh changes you have made\r\n    user=> (reset)\r\n    \r\n    ;; stop the API or site\r\n    user=> (stop)\r\n    \r\n### Viewing metrics\r\nThe screenshot below shows the default metrics available as soon as you start your Life project.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garycrawford/lein-life/master/images/stats.png\" alt=\"Grafana stats\" title=\"Screenshot of Grafana stats\" />\r\n\r\nTo see these simply browse to http://192.168.59.103. (N.B. so far this is only tested on a Mac using boot2docker). You will start to see stats once you start your 'site' or 'API' (see above).\r\n\r\nN.B. boot2docker has a clock skew issue - if you cannot see metrics you should try running the following command on the host:\r\n\r\n    $ boot2docker ssh sudo ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
